CMTJ is a library for simulating multilayer magnetic structures. Each structure is called a {\ttfamily junction} and is composed of magnetic {\ttfamily layers}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
Both C++ and Python interfaces are first-\/class citizens, but because of how this project is structured Python code is generated from the C++ code. In case of linting problems, please report the issue on Github. \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{C++}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
The C++ library requires no installation, only the inclusion of the headers. The basic headers you\textquotesingle{}ll need are \href{core/junction.hpp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily junction.\+hpp}}} and \href{core/cvector.hpp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily cvector.\+hpp}}}. Beyond that, there\textquotesingle{}s \href{core/compute.hpp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily compute.\+hpp}}} that contains utilities for FFT compute, mainly for Voltage Spin Diode and PIMM. There\textquotesingle{}s also \href{core/stack.hpp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily stack.\+hpp}}}, for stacking the whole junctions into stacks, but as of now it\textquotesingle{}s WIP.

But if you wish to use functions from \href{core/compute.hpp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily compute.\+hpp}}}, then there\textquotesingle{}s an extra dependency on {\ttfamily fftw3}. To install it follow the main source page for {\ttfamily fftw3} -- \href{http://www.fftw.org/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+fftw.\+org/}}. Here are some quick things that may work for you.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Mac\+Os 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{brew install fftw}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Linux 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{apt-\/get install -\/y libfftw3-\/dev}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Windows (no idea, please check the fftw source page linked above)

The python package is to be installed from main directory. Go up from this file\textquotesingle{}s directory. Then, launch the pip installation. It should compile the C++ code and bind it to the Python module. Please report all compilation errors so that we may help you debug it.

You\textquotesingle{}ll also need {\ttfamily pybind11} python package\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pip3 install pybind11}

\end{DoxyCode}


Pip installation command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pip3 install -\/e .}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Requirements summary \+:warning\+:}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
The C++ version basically requires only\+: ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item FFTW3 (only for \href{core/compute.hpp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily compute.\+hpp}}}) The library for computing the Fast Fourier Transform, needed for some of the frequency analysis included in the package

The library may be downloaded from the link here \href{http://www.fftw.org/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+fftw.\+org/}}. ~\newline
 However, if you\textquotesingle{}re on the Ubuntu (it may work for some other distros as well), you may install the package with\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{apt-\/get install -\/y libfftw3-\/dev}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Py\+Bind11 (only if you want to compile the {\ttfamily python3} yourself) Py\+Bind11 allows us to bind pieces of C++ code to be usable from within the Python code. This package {\itshape is not} necessary if you just plan to use the C++ API. Otherwise, if you need to compile the Py\+MTJ yourself, then you should install this package.

The library is available here \href{https://github.com/pybind/pybind11}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/pybind/pybind11}}.

 It contains some ready-\/to-\/use examples for the experimental setting. If you\textquotesingle{}d like me to add an experimental setup, post an issue there. For theorethical contributions, submit an issue in this repo.
