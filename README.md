CMTJ is a set of C++ headers for spin magnetics in Magnetic Tunnel Junctions, with some bindings from C++ to Python, but there's also a Python standalone library called PyMTJ. The Python standalone library, the PyMTJ, is not maintained actively, but you are welcome to contribute if you would like to see it revived. Until then, C++ with Python bindings, i.e. CMTJ, is the best choice if you want to go with a maintained version.
