## Short description
The library allows for macromagnetic simulation of multilayer spintronic structures.
A name may be misleading -- the MTJ (Magnetic Tunnel Junctions) are not the only structures that may be simulated. 

## Quickstart
#### Installation :rocket:
Installation is as easy as doing:
```bash
python3 -m pip install cmtj
```

If you prefer to clone the repo first and then install directly from the source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LemurPwned/cmtj.git
python3 -m pip install .
```

Documentation: [https://lemurpwned.github.io/cmtj](https://lemurpwned.github.io/cmtj)


## WIKI :mortar_board:
Read more in do [the docs here](https://lemurpwned.github.io/cmtj/).

## Extensions 
There's a GUI version available! If you wish to conduct a subset of simulations, mainly for experimental modelling, please see the *PyMag* project. It uses CMTJ as a backend for fast computation.
