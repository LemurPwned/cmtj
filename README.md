## Intro
CMTJ is a set of C++ headers for spin magnetics in multilayer devices (not only MTJs!), with some bindings from C++ to Python, but there's also a Python standalone library called PyMTJ. 
The Python standalone library, the PyMTJ, is not maintained actively, but you are welcome to contribute if you would like to see it revived. Until then, C++ with Python bindings, i.e. CMTJ, is the best choice if you want to go with a maintained version.

## Installation :rocket:
Installation is as easy as doing:
```bash
python3 -m install cmtj
```

If you prefer to clone the repo first and then install directly from the source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LemurPwned/cmtj.git
python3 -m pip install .
```
