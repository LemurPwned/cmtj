# CMTJ

## Short description
The library allows for macromagnetic simulation of multilayer spintronic structures.
A name may be misleading -- the MTJ (Magnetic Tunnel Junctions) are not the only structures that may be simulated. 

## Extensions 
There's a GUI version available! If you wish to conduct a subset of simulations, mainly for experimental modelling, please see the *PyMag* project. It uses CMTJ as a backend for fast computation.
## Citing 
Please cite if you decide to use the project
